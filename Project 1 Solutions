(1) Read and Write Latency for Cache and DRAM
_____________________________________________

Zero queueing delay implies that there is no wait for
data writing or access. This means that the system
should be idling, or as close to idling as possible
to get an accurate reading of unloaded latencies.

The size of the caches for the target processor,
an Intel Core i7-12700K, are as follows:
L1: 1.0 MB
L2: 12.0 MB
L3: 25.0 MB

To test latencies, we will use the MLC commands below:
Testing L1
mlc --idle_latency -b900k

Testing L2
mlc --idle_latency -b11m

Testing L3
mlc --idle_latency -b23m

Testing DRAM
mlc --idle_latency -b60m

These commands yielded the following data, averaged
over three runs each:
L1 Cache Read Latency: 3.93 ns
L2 Cache Read Latency: 16.87 ns
L3 Cache Read Latency: 36.30 ns
DRAM Read Latency:     69.87 ns

(2) DRAM Maximum Bandwidth
__________________________

The Intel MLC uses the size of the allocated buffer
to determine the Bandwidth of a particular memory
hierarchy level. Need to find out the command line
parameters to configure the size of this. Then, can
determine what the latencies of different levels are.

max bandwidth we can get with stride byte size of 64 (for all read, 3:1 read, 2:1 read, 1:1 read)
--peak_injection_bandwidth -X -b100m -l64

max bandwidth we can get with stride byte size of 256 (for all read, 3:1 read, 2:1 read, 1:1 read)
--peak_injection_bandwidth -X -b100m -l256

max bandwidth we can get with stride byte size of 1024 (for all read, 3:1 read, 2:1 read, 1:1 read)
--peak_injection_bandwidth -X -b100m -l1024

we measure all write for default value of 64 bytes
--bandwidth_matrix -w6

according to the readme, the bandwidth matrix command is supposed to be able to use -ln and -Wn 
together, but it results in an error so we have no way to analyze all write bandwidth for
256 bytes and 1024 bytes
