(1) Read and Write Latency for Cache and DRAM 

(2) DRAM Maximum Bandwidth
The Intel MLC uses the size of the allocated buffer
to determine the Bandwidth of a particular memory
hierarchy level. Need to find out the command line
parameters to configure the size of this. Then, can
determine what the latencies of different levels are.

(3) The Tradeoff Between Latency and Bandwidth of DRAM

(4) Impact of Cache Miss Ratio on Performance

(5) Impact of TLB Miss Ratio on Performance
